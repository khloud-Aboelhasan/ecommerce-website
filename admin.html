  <section class="Timeline">
    <p>I'm Johan Client. I was born in 1995. When I was young I used to do many activites like swimming, playing
      football and writing short stories but I had a favourite hobby which was selling things.
      I'll tell you a funny story about this hobby when I was 14, I bought a box of biscuits and sold a single packet
      for 2 pounds to my classmates as this biscuits wasn't found in our school at that time and I earned 20 pounds I
      won 10 pounds as I bought the box for only 10 pounds .</p>
    <p>Many people
      told me that I was perfect at selling things as I could earn much and I was only 14 I used my mind to do something
      which is business. So, from this story I dreamed to have a store to sell clothes, accessories and etc.
      After that when I became 16 my dad bought me some clothes to sell them for the people I shared the pictures of the
      clothes on a facebook page which was my friend's page as he had alot of followers and likes so many people can see
      his page
      and I sold my clothes.</p>
    <p>I earned alot from these clothes so I liked this way too much and I determined to make my own page when I can buy
      many things to sell them and earn alot of money and I enojyed my hobby alot and I
      made it my own business. After that I joined the faculty of business and graduated from it. </p>
    <p>Mum and dad helped me by some money to open my small own store and I did so.
      My own store was very simple at that time it was like a mini market. When I
      opened it I didn't have many clients and this disappointed me alot but,
      my parents supported me to continue. One day, my old friend who helped me
      when we were young asked me to take a picture of my small store to share the
      picture on his page and then many people came to buy my products.</p>

    <p>After that
      I earned alot of money then from this time I made my own store's page as you
      can read my info from it. I just want to say that I have made everything from
      scratch when it was a dream and it finally became a true so everyone one must follow his dreams and believe in it.
